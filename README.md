# RBVMS

Application that can simulate incompressible flow
using the residual-based variational multiscale (RBVMS) formulation.
This novel formulation is also suitable as a Large-Eddy Simulation model at turbulent Reynolds numbers.

Novel features include:
* Formulation combining numerical and physical arguments
* * Local Momentum conservation
* * Local Angular momentum conservation
* Wide range of discretisation possible, including
* * Tetrahedral
* * Isogeometric
* Weak imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions
* Conservative boundary forces extraction
* Symmetry BC -- TBD

For details on the formulation see:

Large eddy simulation of turbulent Taylorâ€“Couette flow using isogeometric analysis and the residual-based variational multiscale method,

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2010.01.008.

The parallel application is build on [mfem](https://github.com/mfem/mfem), a
lightweight, general, scalable C++ library for finite element methods.

## Install

To install RBVMS on a Ubuntu-based machine make sure the appropriate packages are installed.

Before installing the packages make sure the machine is updated, by running the folliwing commands in a terminal:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Install the required packages by running the following command in a terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install cmake git build-essential openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev libmetis5 libmetis-dev
```

The RBVMS code can be downloaded using the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:IdoAkkerman/rbvms.git

```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/IdoAkkerman/rbvms.git

```
This will create a directory `rbvms` with the code in it. This code can be compiled using the following commands:

```
cd rbvms
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 16
```

Here the number 16 is the number of files that will be compiled concurrently.
NB: This number you choose should depend on the number of cores you have available.

Depending on the machine compilation might take a few minutes.
After this hypre and MFEM will be installed in the `build/external` directory, and
the rbvms executable can be found in the `bin` directory.

## Cases

2D
1. Lid driven cavity: tbd
2. Von Karman vortex street: see cases/von-karman-re100
3. Naca foil: tbd

3D tbd
1. Von Karman vortex street
2. Naca foil
3. Gresho vortex
4. Taylor-green vortex
5. Turbulent channel
6. Taylor Couette flow

## Run
The code can be run by running
```
$BUILD/bin/rbvms
```

Where `$BUILD` is the directory where `cmake` was run.

To see all the command line options run:
```
$BUILD/bin/rbvms -h
```

### Isogeometric


### GMSH

GMSH is an open-source mesher. On Ubuntu-based machine the package can be installed
using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install gmsh
```

### Visualization using Visit

The results can be visualized using [Visit] https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/index.html.
Which is an open-source tool that can natively visualize NURBS based solutions.
